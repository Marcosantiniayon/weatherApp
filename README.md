# Weather App

## Overview
This weather app is built as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch weather forecasts and display them on a dynamically updated web page. Users can search for weather by location and toggle the display between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The app's design changes based on the weather data and location time, enhancing user experience with visual feedback that reflects the current weather conditions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Weather Search**: Search for any city to get real-time weather updates.
- **Temperature Unit Toggling**: Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius views.
- **Dynamic UI Changes**: The background and theme of the app change based on the fetched weather conditions.
- **Modular Code**: Organized codebase using Webpack to bundle different modules (`ui.js`, `api.js`, `utilities.js`).
- **Loading Component**: A loading indicator appears while weather data is being fetched, enhancing user experience during wait times.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Project Insights
This project helped me understand the intricacies of fetching and displaying data from an external API using modern JavaScript. It also provided practical experience in using promises and async/await for handling asynchronous operations, and in deploying modular JavaScript applications using Webpack.
